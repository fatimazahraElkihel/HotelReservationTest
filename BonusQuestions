 Answer for question 1 :

No, this is not the recommended approach in a real-world application.

Putting all the functions in a single service makes the class responsible for multiple concerns such as user management, room management, and booking logic.
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to maintain and scale.

However, for a technical test or a small application, this approach is acceptable because it keeps the implementation simple and easy to understand.

Answer for question 2:

Another way to handle this is to make rooms immutable or to version the rooms. Instead of updating an existing room, a new version of the room could be created, 
and new bookings would reference the new version while old bookings would keep referencing the old one.

In this solution, the recommended approach is to store a snapshot of the room and user data inside the booking at the time of reservation. 
This ensures that previous bookings remain unchanged even if the room information is updated later. This approach is simple, reliable, and well suited for a booking system.
